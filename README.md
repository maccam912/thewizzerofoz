# The Wizzer of Oz

While on a walk with my wife and puppers Benji (hence the original name "Benjiwalk") we came up with a good idea to test out [GGEZ](https://github.com/ggez/ggez). Here it is after a few hours of work. I was brand new to GGEZ and still only about a week into learning Rust.

## Build and Run

To build, clone the repository and run `cargo build` or `cargo build --release`. If you want to build and run, do `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`. The framerate is much better with the `--release` flag.

## Controls
To play, use arrow keys to move Benji around the screen. He likes to pee on everything, but you will only get points for peeing on fire hydrants. Use `space` to pee on something, arrow keys to move, and `return` to start a new game. My high score during testing is 1656.

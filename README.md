# The Wizzer of Oz

While on a walk with my wife and puppers Benji (hence the original name "Benjiwalk") we came up with a good idea to test out [GGEZ](https://github.com/ggez/ggez). Here it is after a few hours of work. I was brand new to GGEZ and still only about a week into learning Rust.

## Build and Run

To build, clone the repository and run `cargo build` or `cargo build --release`. If you want to build and run, do `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`. The framerate is much better with the `--release` flag.
